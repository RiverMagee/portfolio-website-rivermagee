Using R Programming, I used an NBA data set that contained information regarding hundreds of players' individual performance statistics. With this data, I was able to determine any possible connections between shooting percentages, rebounding, assists, and Win-Share percentages (the amount a player individually contributed to a team win.) Additionally, I ran analyses on the top 10 draft picks of the previous 20 years, and whether or not draft numbers correlated to career success. 

The results are listed below:

3-Point Shooting Percentage shows no discernible correlation to win-share rates. However, a minor positive upward trend can be identified for an increase in 2-point shot efficiency and an increase in win-share rate.

Assists-Per-Game shows no discernible correlation to win-share rates. However, a minor positive upward trend can be identified for an increase in Rebounds-Per-Game and an increase in win-share rate.

Additionally, I discovered the #1 Draft Pick is 2x as likely to become an All-Star at some point in their career compared to the #2 Draft Pick. The #1 Draft Pick is also 2.5X more likely to be a 5X All-Star during their career compared to the #2 Draft Pick.
